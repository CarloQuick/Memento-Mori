# Memento Mori VS Code Extension

## Features

This minimalist extension displays a simple, timeless quote inspired by Stoic philosophy whenever triggered. Created to serve as a quiet mental reset throughout the day, it’s a personal tool designed to encourage mindfulness, clarity, and emotional balance—reminding us of what really matters, one quote at a time.

It uses the [stoic-quote-lambda-public-api](https://github.com/tlcheah2/stoic-quote-lambda-public-api) by [tlcheah2](https://github.com/tlcheah2) for the Stoic quotes.
